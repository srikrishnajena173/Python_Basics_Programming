################## Functions  #################

# So we have some built-in python functions and also user defined functions

# Built-in Python functions such as 
print()
max()
min()
len()
list()


# 2. And the user defined functions like 
def my_func():
    pass

############### Methods ##############

# Methods are completely different from the functions and we use as below 
# .method_name()

# Example 1.
my_list = []
list.sort() # so here sort() is a method of list 

# Example 2.
my_string = 'Hello'
my_string.index() # so here the index() is the mehtod of string
