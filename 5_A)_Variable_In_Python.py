# Explore the variable in python, suppose 

# Example 1 :- 
myval = 190
print(myval) # so , here is store the value i.e. 190 in a variable called myval
# NOTE :- The python internally stores the value in binary format, 
# but when we print it will return the decimal form i.e. 190

# NOTE :- You should not create the variable with Python reserved keyword
#  (like :- print, and , or , int)

# Example 2 :- 
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)

# O/P :- 1 2 3

# Now whats the difference between the expression and statment , just remember this
iq = 190
data = iq / 4
# So, here  "iq / 4" is a expression, however the "data = iq / 4" is a statment
