# Matrix means multi-dimenssion array, it can be a 2D array or 3D array or so on.

# Lets explore the 2D array 
matrix = [
    [1,2,3,4],
    [5,6,7,8],
    [9,10,11,12]
]  # So here its 3*5 matrix

# Now how to access the 2D array value 
print(matrix[0][1]) # so here we are accessing the 2 value from 2D array i.e 0th index row and 1st index
# column
